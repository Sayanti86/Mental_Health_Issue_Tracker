## Overview


## Description of the data


## Usage scenario & tasks

The app contains two tabs: Home and Details. Users can switch between tabs by clicking the corresponding buttons in the top bar. In the Home page the user will find some general outcomes from the survey: a wordcloud showing the main common health issues reported by the interviewees and two bar charts related to the employee’s awareness of the mental health care options provided by their employer’s health benefits packages. In the Details tab a set of dropdown lists allow users to play with the data, by customizing the charts displayed helping them carry out their analysis. Two of the charts display the percentage of people who have reported having had mental disorders in the past vs. people who reported a current mental health disorder, detailing whether they were diagnosed by a professional and if they sought professional help. The third chart compares the interference on work when a mental health disorder is treated effectively versus when it’s not.
